# The Cost of Housing, by the Square Foot

This simple app merely displays the mean price per square foot for housing within each state across a slew of years, as recorded by Zillow.com.  The point here is to explore how the price of housing has increased over time.  Further extrapolations beyond this can include taking that as a measure of cost-of-living concerns in the same mapped area, versus mean income, et cetera.

# Using This Appplication

The use of this application is extremely simple at this early stage.  Simply drag the sliding bar through the years and forgive the moment's refresh of the map to see the differences not only between the states, but within the states over time as well.

Notice that not every state has provided information, and that some begin providing information during the increase of the measured years.
